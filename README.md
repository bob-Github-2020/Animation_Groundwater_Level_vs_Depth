# Animation: Groundwater Level vs. Well Depth

  Supplemental_animation.mp4

This animation using the groundwater level measurements from 740 wells in the southeast Houston region, Texas.This animated visualization demonstrates the correlation between well depth and groundwater level, revealing a predominant trend of declining groundwater levels with increasing well depth. It utilizes smoothed groundwater-level time series data from 740 wells within the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District (HGSD) Areas 1 and 2.

do_GW_animation.py is the Python program used to generate the animation. All groundwater-level time series from 740 wells are zipped in Groundwater_Data.zip.
